#Livet, a MVVM Infrastructure for WPF
===

##What's Livet ??
---
Livet is a very powerful MVVM Infrastructure for WPF,and it's developped by Japanese MVVMers.This project is started from 2010/10/12, originally on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ugaya40/livet), then move to [Github](https://github.com/ugaya40/Livet)  at 2012/7/29.

##Contribute Livet !!
---
We're welcoming anyone who loves WPF and MVVM for our project. Don's hesitate to folk, to pull request, and to post issues.

In addition, since Livet is developped by Japanese, there are few English documents (and other languages' ones, of course). So we're looking for contributors who translate our Japanese Documents to English.
