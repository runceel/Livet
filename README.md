##What's Livet ??
---
Livet is a very powerful MVVM Infrastructure for WPF,and it's developped by Japanese MVVMers.This project is started from 2010/10/12, originally on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ugaya40/livet), then move to [Github](https://github.com/ugaya40/Livet)  at 2012/7/29.

##Contribute Us!!
---
As mentioned above, Livet is developped by Japanese, so there are few documents in English (and other languages, of course). So we're looking for contributors who translate them.
