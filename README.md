#Livet, a MVVM Infrastructure for WPF
===

##What's Livet ??
---
Livet is a very powerful MVVM Infrastructure for WPF, and developed by Japanese MVVMers. This project is started from 2010/10/12, originally on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ugaya40/livet), then moved to [Github](https://github.com/ugaya40/Livet) at 2012/7/29.

##Contribute Livet !!
---
We're welcoming anyone who loves WPF and MVVM for our project. Don't hesitate to fork, send pull requests, and post issues.

In addition, since Livet is developed by Japanese, there are few English documents (and none of any other languages, of course). So we're looking for contributors who translate our Japanese Documents into English.
